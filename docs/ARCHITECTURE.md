Removed from the current architecture:

- no `backend/api/ebay.py`
- no `services/notifications.py`
- no old nested `pokemon-tcg-collection/` directory

## Backend Architecture

### Router Registration

`backend/main.py` registers feature routers under `/api/*`.

Important modules added since the older docs:

- `api/auth.py`
- `api/github.py`
- `api/images.py`
- `api/products.py`

### Data Model

Key ORM models in `backend/models.py`:

- `Set`
- `Card`
- `User`
- `CollectionItem`
- `WishlistItem`
- `Binder`
- `BinderCard`
- `ProductPurchase`
- `SyncLog`
- `PortfolioSnapshot`
- `Setting`
- `UserSetting`
- `CustomCardMatch`
- `ImageCache`
- `ScanJob`
- `ScanJobItem`
- `ScanQueueUserState`
- `GeminiQuotaState`

Notable current model rules:

- `Set.id` and `Card.id` are composite ids with TCGdex language suffixes, including multi-part codes such as `zh-tw` and `pt-br`
- `Card.rarity` comes from TCGdex and is treated as read-only metadata
- Card data, image, and price fallback source languages are tagged when English exact-ID fallback data is used
- Collection variants are limited to physical print variants
- Wishlist items store requested quantity from `1` to `99`
- `User.must_change_password` drives the forced password change flow
- `UserSetting` stores per-user preferences and secrets

## Settings Architecture

Settings are split between two stores:

- Global `settings` table
- Per-user `user_settings` table

The split is defined in `backend/api/settings.py`:

- `PER_USER_KEYS`
  - language
  - currency
  - price display preferences
  - Telegram keys and alert preferences
  - Gemini key
  - scanner diagnostics consent
  - trainer name
- `ADMIN_ONLY_KEYS`
  - full sync interval
  - price sync interval
  - multi-user mode
  - TCGdex sync languages

Effectively:

- normal users can only change their own per-user settings
- admins can also change global operational settings
- per-user settings isolation is enforced in the API layer
- `tcgdex_sync_languages` controls which TCGdex set/card languages full sync fetches. It defaults to `en,de`; extra languages are optional because they increase sync time, API calls, and database size.
- Invalid or empty `TCGDEX_SYNC_LANGUAGES` env values fall back safely to `en,de` during first bootstrap; the env value `all` expands to every supported TCGdex language
- App UI language selection is separate from TCGdex sync-language selection. The UI selector includes all supported TCGdex language codes plus Swedish.

## Authentication Architecture

Authentication lives in:

- `backend/api/auth.py`
- `backend/services/auth.py`
- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`

Current auth model:

- Single-user mode returns the admin user from `get_current_user()` when no token is present
- Multi-user mode requires JWT authentication
- `/api/auth/mode` exposes whether the app is in single-user or multi-user mode
- `must_change_password` is returned by `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/me`
- The frontend blocks protected routes until forced password change is completed

## Scanner Flow

Recognition is implemented in `backend/api/recognize.py` and surfaced through `frontend/src/components/UnifiedCardScanner.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/ScanQueue.jsx`, and the shared add/review components.

Current flow:

1. The user captures or uploads up to 50 photos. Uploads are size-limited, re-encoded, orientation-normalized, stripped of metadata, and stored as private JPEG files.
2. Single photos run individually. Batch-eligible photos are grouped into two-to-four-card composites to reduce Gemini calls; uncertain composite positions fall back to their original individual photo.
3. Gemini extracts name, split collector number, printed total, set code, regulation mark, type, HP, language, and artist. Unclear small text must be returned as `null`.
4. TCGdex candidates are searched in the detected language with English fallback and ranked deterministically by local number, language, printed total, set code, regulation mark, artist, and HP. Missing fields are neutral; contradictions reduce rank.
5. When metadata remains inconclusive, conservative pHash compares the original photo with a bounded candidate set. It accepts only a close, clearly separated winner with no metadata contradiction.
6. Individual scans may use a second Gemini visual comparison if pHash abstains. Composite scans instead return to the individual queue path.
7. Results are persisted in the `/scans` review inbox. Confirming or dismissing an item deletes its queued photo; unresolved jobs expire after 14 days.

`backend/services/scan_queue.py` provides fair, restart-safe background dispatch with leases. Recognition attempts are capped separately from transient quota failures. `backend/services/gemini_rate_limit.py` shares quota state by API-key fingerprint so concurrent users of the same key cannot bypass a provider delay; distinct keys remain independent. Structured daily-quota signals are separated from short-term limits, and provider `Retry-After` / `google.rpc.RetryInfo` delays take precedence over fallback backoff.

Optional diagnostics live in `backend/services/scan_trace.py`. The server must set `SCAN_TRACE_DIR`, and each user must separately enable **Share scanner diagnostics** (off by default). Only opted-in attempts store a sanitized photo plus structured extraction/search/ranking data. Turning the toggle off stops future traces without deleting old ones; the adjacent delete action removes that user's trace subtree. `SCAN_TRACE_STORAGE_DIR` remains stable when collection is disabled so explicit and account deletion can still find old data. Account deletion writes a revocation marker before cleanup so an in-flight attempt cannot recreate the deleted user's files. No Gemini key or authentication credential is recorded.

## Frontend State

Current frontend state layers:

- Server state: TanStack Query
- Auth state: `AuthContext`
- Settings and i18n state: `SettingsContext`
- Local UI state: component-level `useState`
- Theme state: `useTheme` with `data-theme` and local storage

`AuthContext` is now a core part of the app architecture, not an optional enhancement.

## Navigation Architecture

- `HomeScreen.jsx` is the compact portal entry point
- `Layout.jsx` wraps protected routes
- `AppNav.jsx` provides the page title strip and logout affordance
- `TabNav.jsx` is the shared section tab component used across major screens

## Integrations

### TCGdex

- Set and card source of truth
- Variant availability flags come from TCGdex
- Rarity is read from TCGdex and shown read-only
- Supported sync languages are centralized in `backend/services/tcgdex_languages.py`
- English is the preferred fallback for missing data, images, and prices only when the same exact TCGdex card or set ID exists in English
- Regional-only cards are not guessed by translated name

### Gemini

- Used for smart scanner recognition
- Key is read per user from `user_settings`
- Scanner model is configurable through `GEMINI_MODEL` and defaults to `gemini-flash-latest`
- Scanner calls use the API-key header rather than putting the key in the request URL
- Transient capacity failures are retried; rate limits, invalid keys, and unavailable models are reported separately

### Telegram

- Implemented in `backend/services/telegram.py`
- Service accepts `user_id` so alerts use that user's Telegram credentials

### GitHub / Community

- `backend/api/github.py` fetches contributors from the GitHub API
- Supporters are read from `SUPPORTERS.csv`
- `frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx` renders both in the Community section

## Security Notes

- Sync endpoints are admin-only
- Backup and restore are admin-only
- Settings keys are separated into admin-only and per-user scopes
- Frontend logout clears local storage and forces a full reload to avoid leaking cached user data across sessions
- User deletion explicitly removes owned rows from collection, wishlist, binders, products, portfolio snapshots, and user settings before deleting the user

## Migration Notes

Schema changes are handled by idempotent SQL in `backend/database.py`, not Alembic.

Some migration comments still mention historical features, but the current runtime architecture does not include eBay integration and does not expose grading in the active UI or ORM model.
